<p class="lead mt-5">
  HAProxy Ingress watches gateway, ingress and other resources from a Kubernetes cluster,
  and configures a HAProxy instance which will route incoming requests to the pods.
  Updates to the cluster state is automatically applied to the HAProxy instance.

  HAProxy is a fast and reliable TCP and HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer.
  HAProxy Ingress carefully build an optimized HAProxy configuration, which allows
  thousands of requests per second per proxy, despite the size of your cluster,
  with a very low latency.

  Kubernetes is a system which automates the deployment of containerized applications.
  HAProxy Ingress uses deployment and exposing spec from the Kubernetes cluster
  to build routing rules, allowing incoming requests from an external network
  to the in-cluster applications.
