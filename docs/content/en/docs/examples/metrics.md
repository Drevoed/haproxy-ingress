{{% pageinfo %}}
This is a `v0.10` example and need HAProxy Ingress `v0.10-snapshot.5` or above
{{% /pageinfo %}}

This example demonstrates how to configure [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) to collect ingress controller and haproxy metrics, and also to configure a [Grafana](https://grafana.com) dashboard to expose these metrics.

## Prerequisites

This document has the following prerequisite:

* A Kubernetes cluster with a running HAProxy Ingress controller v0.10 or above. See the [getting started]({{% relref "../getting-started" %}}) guide.

## Configure the controller

HAProxy Ingress by default does not configure the haproxy's prometheus exporter. The patch below configures the haproxy's internal prometheus exporter in the port `9105`:

```
kubectl --namespace ingress-controller patch configmap haproxy-ingress -p '{"data":{"prometheus-port":"9105"}}'
```

The following patch adds ports `9105` and `10254` to the HAProxy Ingress container. The port declaration is used by the Prometheus' service discovery:

Note: this patch will restart the controller!

```
kubectl --namespace ingress-controller patch deployment haproxy-ingress -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"haproxy-ingress","ports":[{"name":"exporter","containerPort":9105},{"name":"ingress-stats","containerPort":10254}]}]}}}}'
```

## Deploy Prometheus

This will create a Prometheus deployment with no resource limits, a configuration file which will scrape haproxy and also HAProxy Ingress metrics every `10s`, and also a role and rolebinding which allows Prometheus to discover haproxy and controller endpoints using k8s:

```
kubectl create -f https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/docs/examples/metrics/prometheus.yaml
```

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
This deployment has no persistent volume, so all the collected metrics will be lost if the pod is recreated.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
If HAProxy Ingress wasn't deployed with Helm, change the following line in the `configmap/prometheus-cfg` resource, jobs `haproxy-ingress` and `haproxy-exporter`:

```diff
       relabel_configs:
-      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app_kubernetes_io_instance]
+      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_run]
         regex: haproxy-ingress
```

This will ensure that Prometheus finds the controller pods.
{{% /alert %}}

Check if Prometheus is up and running:

```
kubectl --namespace ingress-controller get pod -lrun=prometheus -w
```

Check also if Prometheus found the haproxy and the controller endpoints:

```
kubectl --namespace ingress-controller port-forward svc/prometheus 9090:9090
```

Open [localhost:9090/targets](http://127.0.0.1:9090/targets) in your browser, all haproxy and controller instances should be listed, up, and green.

## Deploy Grafana

The following instruction will create a Grafana deployment with no resource limit, and also its service:

```
kubectl create -f https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/docs/examples/metrics/grafana.yaml
```

Check if Grafana is up and running:

```
kubectl --namespace ingress-controller get pod -lrun=grafana -w
```

Create the ingress which will expose Grafana. Change `HOST` below to a domain of the cluster, or just change the inner IP number to the IP of the HAProxy Ingress node:

```
HOST=grafana.192.168.1.1.nip.io
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: grafana
  namespace: ingress-controller
spec:
  rules:
  - host: $HOST
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: grafana
          servicePort: 3000
        path: /
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - $HOST
EOF
```

## Configure dashboard

Now its time to see what Prometheus is collecting. Grafana can be acessed in the `HOST` used to configure the ingress object.

* Log in to Grafana, user is `admin` and the first password is `admin`
* Create a Prometheus data source, the endpoint is `http://prometheus:9090`
* Click the big `+` plus sign in the left side, and Import [this](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12056) dashboard

{{% alert title="Note" %}}
This deployment has no persistent volume, so all customizations will be lost if the pod is recreated.
{{% /alert %}}

If everything worked as expected, you should see a dashboard like this:

![](/docs/examples/metrics/dashboard-1.png)

## Compatibility

Check if you have any of these scenarios and adjust Prometheus or Grafana accordingly.

**Grafana < 6.5**

Use Grafana 6.5 or higher. Although an older Grafana won't refuse to install this dashboard, some widgets will not render as expected on older versions.

**The `hostname` label**

All the metrics of this dashboard are grouped by the `hostname` label. If you already have Prometheus and HAProxy Exporter, ensure that the `hostname` label uniquely identifies all HAProxy Ingress instances, just like the proposed Prometheus configuration does.

**The `_front__tls` proxy**

This dashboard is designed to work without the `_front__tls` proxy, such proxy is created whenever ssl-passthrough is used or timeout client is configured in the ingress object. Just to be sure, check if `grep _front__tls /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg` find a proxy declaration. If the `_front__tls` proxy exists, edit the dashboard and change the variable `$public_frontend` to the following new value: `(_tcp_.*|_front_http|_front__tls)`

**Using the Prometheus' HAProxy Exporter**

This dashboard works with haproxy's internal Prometheus exporter. Follow these steps to adjust the scrape config and the dashboard if using [Prometheus' HAProxy Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/haproxy_exporter):

* Change the metric name of "Backend status / Top 5 max/avg connection time" to `haproxy_backend_http_connect_time_average_seconds`
* Add this `metric_relabel_config` in the Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
      metric_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [frontend]
        regex: (.+)
        target_label: proxy
      - source_labels: [backend]
        regex: (.+)
        target_label: proxy
```

## Test

Lets make some noise and see what the dashboard tell us about our HAProxy Ingress cluster.

Deploy a demo application and a custom (self-signed) certificate:

```
openssl req -x509 -subj "/CN=whoami.localdomain" -nodes -days 30 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /tmp/w.key -out /tmp/w.crt
kubectl --namespace default create secret tls whoami --cert /tmp/w.crt --key /tmp/w.key
rm -fv /tmp/w.crt /tmp/w.key
kubectl --namespace default create deploy whoami --image jcmoraisjr/whoami
kubectl --namespace default scale deploy whoami --replicas=4
kubectl --namespace default expose deploy whoami --port 8000
kubectl create -f https://haproxy-ingress.github.io/docs/examples/metrics/whoami-ingress.yaml
```

Check if the app is up and running:

```
kubectl --namespace default get pod -lapp=whoami -w
```

Download [vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta/releases) and place it in the path.

Make a test and check if everything is working as expected. Change IP below to the IP of a HAProxy Ingress node:

```
IP=192.168.1.1
echo "GET http://${IP}" |\
  vegeta attack -duration=1s -rate=1 -header "Host: whoami.localdomain" -keepalive=true |\
  vegeta report
```

You should see something like this. The most important part is Success ratio=100% and an Error Set empty:

```
...
Success       [ratio]                    100.00%
Status Codes  [code:count]               200:1
Error Set:
```

Now the real test. Adjust the duration and rate (number of requests per second) if needed. A dual core VM dedicated to HAProxy Ingress should accept a few thousands requests per second. Lets configure `200` which should move some lines in the dashoard:

```
IP=192.168.1.1
echo "GET http://${IP}" |\
  vegeta attack -duration=5m -rate=200 -header "Host: whoami.localdomain" -keepalive=true |\
  vegeta report
```

Follow the dashboard while the test is running. Most metrics have its resolution in `1m` (one minute) so you should wait this time to see the correct conn/s, rps, proc use and so on.

What's the impact of not use keepalive? Try the same test, changing only `-keepalive` to  `false`:

```
IP=192.168.1.1
echo "GET http://${IP}" |\
  vegeta attack -duration=5m -rate=200 -header "Host: whoami.localdomain" -keepalive=false |\
  vegeta report
```

Last test: what about TLS connections without keepalive? Change `http` to `https` and add `-insecure` command-line option to Vegeta:

```
IP=192.168.1.1
echo "GET https://${IP}" |\
  vegeta attack -insecure -duration=5m -rate=200 -header "Host: whoami.localdomain" -keepalive=false |\
  vegeta report
```
