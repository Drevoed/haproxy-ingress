## Releases

HAProxy Ingress is released as a Docker image on top of Alpine's flavor of
[HAProxy image](https://hub.docker.com/_/haproxy).

To get an overview of the individual releases and to read the changelog per release follow this [link](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/releases).

Images are built by a [GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress/actions/workflows/image.yaml)
and deployed to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress) and
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jcmoraisjr/haproxy-ingress) whenever a tag is applied.
The `latest` tag will always point to the latest stable version while `canary` tag will always
point to the latest beta-quality and release-candidate versions.

Before the beta-quality releases, the source code could also be tagged and images deployed.
The `snapshot` tag will always point to the latest tagged version, which could be a release,
a beta-quality or a development version.
